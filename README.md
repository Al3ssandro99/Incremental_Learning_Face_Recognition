# Incremental Learning for Face Recognition

The proposed work aims to study techniques for real-time face recognition and continuous learning of faces of previously unknown individuals to the system.

The system is designed to be applied in the field of security. In this case study, two different approaches will be evaluated and compared:

- Detection of faces using HOG algorithm and classification through similarity measurement;
- Detection of faces using MTCNN neural network and classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Results

Based on the experiments carried out with HOG and distance, the following results were obtained:
